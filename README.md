## Known Issue

Currently there's no known issues. If you find any, please kindly open a new one.

## Notes

-   The app only provide a very simple validation, you may want to implement your own.
-   When sending message, your `message` property will not be validated, so make sure you sent the right data!
-   There's no authentication, you may want to implement your own.
-   The **Beta Multi-Device** client use provided Baileys's `makeInMemoryStore` method which will store your data in memory and a json file, you may want to use a better data management.
-   Automatically reading incoming messages is now disabled by default. Uncomment `whatsapp.js:91-105` to enable this behaviour.
-   If you have problems when deploying on **CPanel** or any other similar hosting, transpiling your code into **CommonJS** should fix the problems.

## Notice

This project is intended for learning purpose only, don't use it for spamming or any activities that's prohibited by **WhatsApp**.
